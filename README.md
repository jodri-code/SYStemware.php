### SYStemware's origin story.

## So, what is SYStemware?

SYStemware is an Operating System (OS) built entirely around SYSlang, a language developed by [The CKS Dev Team](https://github.com/CKStudios2018), [TTS](https://github.com/TallerThanShort), and [Me, V1RU5](https://github.com/jodri-code)

SYStemware is basically made up of two other projects made in the past; SYSTEM-O-M4T1C and SYStem.

## SYSTEM-O-M4T1C by CKS4

SYSTEM-O-M4T1C, or M4T1C (pronounced Matic) for short, was a simple copy-paste machine. It had no AI capability and run completely on JavaScript. The actual project weighed just under 7 Gb, which was a lot back in 2016. With the only capability to calculate, it was basically just a huge storage-eating, copy-pasting calculator...

Now, when I say calculate, I don't mean your average `1+1` or `2*92-(-1238+98)*6` here, no... I mean seriously calculate, like trajectories, ETA's nased off of vehicle velocity * traffic speed * average traffic amount.

But of course, this thing had no access to almost any of the data to calculate almost any of the more complicated questions. Therefore, it was abandoned.


## SYStem by The CKS Dev Team

SYStem was a more advanced version of M4T1C, but this time with AI capabilities. Oh, btw, it had a lot of reused code from M4T1C.

It was originally designed as a virtual companion. Because of it's main AI, SYStem was able to learn from what anyone around it said, and then because of M4T1C's old code, it could copy paste it and string it together as an answer (usually the AI thought it was being asked, not declared something...). So basically, the more you talked to it, the more it could talk back, right?.

The problem with that the as the main AI evolved (or better well said, added copy-paste files to it's hard-drive), it would take longer for SYStem to read and even write to it's own dictionary, as it caused the same flaw as it's predecessor. It ate storage too fast.

## SYStemware by The CKS Dev Team (-2) and V1RU5

And that's basically where SYStemware came from. It's not exactly a fusion of both, but only uses (so far) as much space as M4T1C had done. 

The idea is extremely straight-forward and on-point: make an OS and make it *hack*.

We've all heard of OS's like Kali and Arch, the world's best *popOS*... ok jokes aside, SYStemware is just like any of those.

BUT, SYStemware is developed in SYSlang, designed almost specifically just to hack and to give users designated private IP's.

So, what'cha think? Worth it no?

well, what if i told you there are no caps? in systemware you can: code, hack, cheat, steal, game, play, stream, watch videos, listen to music, browse the web securely and much more!
